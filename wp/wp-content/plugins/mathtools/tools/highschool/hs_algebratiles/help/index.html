<!--
NOTE: To include Help... if the Help is HTML - then you could just include it in this HTML file. Otherwise, you can add a redirect to where the actual help file exists by using one of the lines below:

	<meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="0; url=http://www.pearsoned.com/"/>  

	<meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="0; url=myhelpfileinsamedir.pdf"/>

Just copy one of those meta lines and put it within the <head>... </head> section of this document (outside of this comment). Modify the url to be what you need. If it's relative to this location - then use the second one. 
You can then delete the paragraph below that says 'Placeholder... ' so it doesn't flash on screen in the second it takes to redirect.
